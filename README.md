# packablock-registry (Packablock Supply Chain Trust Registry)

The registry server component for Packablock. It receives, verifies, stores, and audits cryptographic package attestation chains pushed by the Packablock client.

## 📋 Features

- **Zero-Trust Package Attestation**: Verifies the cryptographic hashes and integrity signatures of pushed package chains.
- **Parallel Multi-Lockfile Tracking**: Tracks multiple lockfiles (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `bun.lockb`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in parallel within a single repository chain.
- **Chain Life-Cycle Events**: Supports dynamic addition and removal of lockfiles mid-chain using `init` and `forget` events.
- **SemVer Drift Detection**: Analyzes package diffs across blocks to alert on version regressions, high drift velocity, and custom security policies.
- **Webhook Integration**: Dispatches outbound event alerts to integrated tools (e.g., Windmill, Slack, GitHub webhooks).

## 💾 Attestation Chain Data Format

The registry parses block payloads using a nested, multi-lockfile layout format where lockfiles are grouped under the `lockfiles` root key. The root payload can also contain a `package.json` key defining package constraints.

### 1. Lockfile Initialization (`init` event)
To start tracking a new lockfile or re-initialize one, include a `chain_event: init` metadata field and the complete list of packages under `lockfiles`:

```yaml
lockfiles:
  package-lock.json:
    chain_event: init
    packages:
      - lodash: "4.17.21"
      - express: "4.18.2"
package.json:
  constraints:
    - lodash: "^4.17.21"
    - express: "^4.18.2"
```

### 2. Lockfile Updates (Diff Format)
Subsequent blocks contain version differences for individual lockfiles rather than full package lists under `lockfiles`:

```yaml
lockfiles:
  package-lock.json:
    packages:
      - lodash: [{ old: "4.17.21" }, { new: "4.17.22" }]
      - debug: [{ new: "4.3.4" }]
```

### 3. Lockfile Removal (`forget` event)
To stop tracking a lockfile entirely and clear it from the repository's active package database state, send a `chain_event: forget` event under `lockfiles`:

```yaml
lockfiles:
  package-lock.json:
    chain_event: forget
```
